### Introduction
<p> In this guide, you'll learn how to create a simple Lua script and attach it to a game object. </p>

### What is a Lua Script?
<p> A Lua script is like a set of instructions written in a language called [Lua](https://www.lua.org/docs.html). 
It's a way to tell your game objects in Unity how to behave and respond to different situations. 
So, if you want your character to jump when you press a button or make a door open when your player approaches it, you'd use a Lua script to make that happen! </p>

<Callout title="Attention" type="warn">
    When constructing a Highrise World, remember that only Lua scripts are included in the package build. Avoid using C# scripts and stick to Lua scripts for implementation.
