<Tab value="Understanding Lighting">
  <strong>Ambient Lighting:</strong> This is like the overall light in a scene that comes from everywhere. It makes sure things aren't too dark and gives a base level of brightness. In Unity, you can change this by adjusting the Ambient Color in the Lighting window. Messing with this color can totally change how your scene feels.
  
  <strong>Skybox Material:</strong> This is what makes the background of your scene look like the sky and surrounding environment. Unity has some ready-made skybox materials for you to use, but you can also make your own or get some from other places. Skybox materials affect how light and colors look in your scene, making it look more realistic and cool.
