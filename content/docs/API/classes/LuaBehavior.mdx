### Introduction
In the Highrise game logic, the LuaBehaviour class is key. 
It's like the glue that connects Lua scripts to GameObjects in Unity. With LuaBehaviour, you can create and manage Lua scripts that control the behavior of your GameObjects.


The keyword `self` refers to the LuaBehaviour instance that the script is attached to.
This way, you can access the GameObject and its components, such as Transform, OnCollisionEnter, and more.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Preview Examples">
```lua
-- Access the GameObject
local myGameObject = self.gameObject

-- Print the GameObject's name
print("My GameObject's name is: " .. myGameObject.name)

-- Output: My GameObject's name is: MyGameObject
```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Properties
The LuaBehaviour class has the following properties:
<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is a property?" className="small-paragraph">
    A property is like a variable that belongs to an object. 
    It can store data and be accessed or modified by other objects.

    For example, the `gameObject` property of the LuaBehaviour class is a property that stores the GameObject that the Lua script is attached to.
    

    Meaning that you can access the GameObject by using the `gameObject` property like this:    
    ```lua
    self.gameObject  -- Access the GameObject that the Lua script is attached to
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
<Callout title="Tip">
  Each property has different properties and methods, to learn more about them, click the title of the property.
</Callout>
<Tabs items={['gameObject', 'transform', 'OnCollisionEnter', 'OnCollisionExit', 'OnCollisionStay', 'OnTriggerEnter', 'OnTriggerExit', 'OnTriggerStay', 'Start', 'Update', 'FixedUpdate', 'LateUpdate', 'Initialize With EventConnection']} defaultIndex={0}>
  <Tab value="gameObject">
    <div className="row-group">
      <h3 className="link-not-prose"> 
        <a className="link-not-prose" href="/docs/API/classes/GameObject">GameObject</a>
      </h3> 
      <p className="tag"> ServerAndClient </p>
    </div>
  
    The GameObject property allows you to access the GameObject that the Lua script is attached to. For example `self.gameObject`.
    #### Example
    ```lua
    -- Access the GameObject
    local myGameObject = self.gameObject

    -- Print the GameObject's name
    print("My GameObject's name is: " .. myGameObject.name)

    -- Output: My GameObject's name is: MyGameObject
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="transform">
    The Transform component of the GameObject.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="OnCollisionEnter">
    A function that is called when the GameObject collides with another GameObject.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="OnCollisionExit">
    A function that is called when the GameObject stops colliding with another GameObject.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="OnCollisionStay">
    A function that is called when the GameObject is colliding with another GameObject.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="OnTriggerEnter">
    A function that is called when the GameObject enters a trigger collider.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="OnTriggerExit">
    A function that is called when the GameObject exits a trigger collider.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="OnTriggerStay">
    A function that is called when the GameObject is inside a trigger collider.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Start">
    A function that is called when the GameObject is initialized.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Update">
    A function that is called every frame.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="FixedUpdate">
    A function that is called every fixed frame.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="LateUpdate">
    A function that is called every frame after all Update functions have been called.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Initialize With EventConnection">
    A function that is called when the GameObject is initialized with an EventConnection.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
